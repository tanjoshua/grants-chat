### Using shadcn for creating ui components
For all UI development:
- Create sleek and simple design.
- Use shadcn/ui as the primary component library
- Follow shadcn/ui's design patterns and theming system
- Leverage shadcn's pre-built components before creating custom ones
- Avoid overriding shadcn's default styles, unless necessary
- Maintain consistency with shadcn's styling approach using Tailwind CSS
- Use shadcn's built-in variant props when relevant and appropriate

For all AI/LLM related development:
- Use Vercel AI SDK (ai package) for handling AI interactions
- Follow Vercel AI SDK patterns for API routes and error handling
- Utilize Vercel AI SDK's built-in TypeScript types
- Refer to llms/vercel-ai-sdk.txt for more information about the AI sdk

These tools should be the default choice unless there's a specific requirement that cannot be met using them.
